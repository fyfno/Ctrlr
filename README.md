### Ctrlr Panel for Dreadbox Nymphes V2

A simple CTRLR panel (https://ctrlr.org/) for Dreadbox Nymphes 6-Voice Analog Synthesizer, as a freebie.

Since I was completely new to Ctrlr and LUA scripting I had a lot of help by reading forum replies of all these helping people at https://ctrlr.org/forums/, especially dnaldoog. I kind of implemented his GSDR (https://ctrlr.org/generic-sysex-dump-editor/) in this panel. thank you all!
